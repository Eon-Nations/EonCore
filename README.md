# Eon Islands Core Plugin

## What is it?
Welcome to Eon Islands! Eon Islands is a large multiplayer experience where players fight for territory and resources to become the best nation. Throughout the islands, there are resource nodes, where players can gather essential resources to make weapons, armor, and survival essentials. There will many worlds to explore, each with unique challenges and strategic locations.

## Motivation
Over the years, I have learned most of my programming fundamentals through coding PaperMC plugins. I wanted to give back everything I have learned to the community and make an amazing, open-source server that anyone can take inspiration from. I will be using the best practices that I have learned working with large networks, and making the best game I can

## When is it coming out?

There is no release date yet, as I want to get the fundamentals down before releasing. As soon as available, I will be making demos and videos about the development to generate some hype about the server. 

## How can I help?

All of the code for this server is open-source, so you are welcome (and encouraged) to contribute to the server in meaningful ways. Whether that's adding a new feature, fixing a bug that's been bothering you, or wanting to make the appearance better. Anyone looking to contribute should look into the Contributing.md file for more info about what is expected.

## Build the Project

In order to build the server, all that required is docker and maven. Fork the project, and clone it into your local directory. All that is needed to run the project is a simple `mvn package`. That will build the plugin jar in the target directory, and you can add it to your local test server to test changes.
